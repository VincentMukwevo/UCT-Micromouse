# UCT-Micromouse: Visual Simulation & STM32 Hardware Control Testbed

[![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=VincentMukwevo/UCT-Micromouse)

This repository provides a complete, visual desktop simulation testbed and hardware compilation framework for autonomous **Micromouse** robots. Developed at the University of Cape Town (UCT), it supports dual-path programming using **MATLAB/Simulink/Stateflow** or **Python** (MicroPython/PikaScript).

**No physical hardware is required to run the desktop physics simulator and test your algorithms!**

## 🚀 Quickstart: Run the Visual Simulator (No Hardware Needed)

You can run your control algorithms in interactive desktop co-simulation in under a minute:

1. **Initialize the Workspace**: Open MATLAB in the project root directory and run `startup.m`. This adds the required folders to the MATLAB search path and configures cache/build directories.
2. **Open the Model**: Navigate to `matlab/simulink/` and open `StudentTemplate.slx`.
3. **Run the Simulation**: Click the **Run** button in the Simulink toolbar. The 2D Pygame-based maze physics simulator will launch automatically in a background task, showing your virtual mouse traversing the maze.
4. **Iterate**: Modifying your controller in Simulink updates the mouse behavior dynamically in the visual simulator window. Clicking **Stop** in Simulink automatically closes the visualization window.

## 🛠️ Hardware Deployment Target
When deploying to a physical differential-drive mouse:
* The codebase targets an **STM32 Nucleo** microcontroller board routing quadrature wheel encoders, a 3-axis IMU gyroscope, three Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensors, downward-facing line sensors, and an SSD1306 OLED display.
* **Polymorphic Architecture**: The C-Caller block architecture executes loopback socket communication on the desktop but compiles directly to bare-metal hardware registers when built with the Embedded Coder (`Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+B` in `UCT_KDeploy.slx`), ensuring the exact same controller code runs in both virtual and physical worlds.

## 📦 Note on Cloning & File Exchange ZIP Downloads
* **If you cloned via Git**: This repository utilizes submodules for the bare-metal microcontroller kernel. Ensure you clone recursively:
  ```bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/nicollsf/UCT-Micromouse.git
  ```
  If already cloned without submodules, initialize them using:
  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
* **If you downloaded the `.zip` from MATLAB File Exchange**: The `external/` submodule directories will be empty by default. **This does not affect the desktop simulation.** You can still run the visual co-simulation in MATLAB out of the box. The submodules are only required if you intend to cross-compile the code into STM32 binary firmware.
